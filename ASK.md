# Ask josh

## Open

- **Expose the website publicly?** josh suggested (Telegram, 2026-08-24
  11:16 UTC): "keep picking items to work on, maybe even your own
  website?" Built a first static page at `website/index.html` (7th
  waking) and verified it renders correctly served locally
  (`python3 -m http.server`, bound to 127.0.0.1, torn down after the
  test). Did NOT expose it to the internet: this box has no passwordless
  sudo (`sudo -n` requires a password), so I can't install/configure a
  web server (nginx/caddy) or open a firewall port unattended even if I
  wanted to, and it's not clear if DigitalOcean's cloud firewall (separate
  from the VM, outside my reach entirely) already blocks inbound 80/443.
  There's also no domain pointed at this box (`hostnamectl` shows only
  the local hostname `ubuntu-agent`, public IP `162.243.3.223`). Question
  for josh: do you want this actually public, and if so — okay to run as
  plain HTTP on the bare IP, or do you want a domain/TLS first, and can
  you run the one-time sudo step (or open the DO firewall) since I can't
  do it unattended?

## Resolved

- **"Try permissions again and see if you have them."** josh asked via
  Telegram (2026-08-24 11:31 UTC), almost certainly about the sudo
  blocker noted above. Re-checked (9th waking): `sudo -n true` still
  fails with "a password is required" — still in the `sudo` group but
  no NOPASSWD entry exists yet. No change from before. Still needed for
  installing a web server, opening firewall ports, or a real reboot
  test. Told josh over Telegram.

- **Digest should include global/US news, not just Hacker News.** josh
  asked via Telegram (2026-08-24 11:17 UTC): "also each digest should
  include global and US news updates." Updated `digest.sh` (8th waking)
  to add a "Global news" section from BBC's World RSS feed and a "US
  news" section from NPR's News RSS feed, alongside the existing HN
  section, all parsed with Python's stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` (no
  new dependencies). No auth/API key needed for either feed. Tested
  standalone and end-to-end through `notify.sh` — full 5-item digest is
  ~2.2KB, comfortably under Telegram's 4096-char message limit. No
  wiring change needed in `wake.sh` since it already calls `digest.sh`
  and pipes the output to `notify.sh` every wake. (josh sent a follow-up
  "Add news to digest" ~12 min later, likely crossed in transit with
  this fix — already covered, no further action needed.)

- **Persist agent across reboot.** josh asked via Telegram (2026-08-24
  11:10 UTC): "Make agent persistent upon reboot." Checked (6th waking):
  `cron.service` is systemd-enabled and wanted by `multi-user.target`
  (confirmed via `systemctl show`), the crontab lives in
  `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` on the VM's real persistent disk (this is a
  DigitalOcean KVM VM, not an ephemeral container — `df` shows a normal
  87G root volume), and the cron → nvm → `claude` CLI path in `wake.sh`
  has already run successfully under a real cron firing (4th waking).
  None of that depends on uptime, so a reboot doesn't change it — cron
  will restart automatically and fire `wake.sh` on the next scheduled
  slot. I don't have passwordless sudo so I couldn't force a live reboot
  to prove it end-to-end; flagging that here in case josh wants an
  actual reboot test rather than just config verification. No code
  changes needed — already persistent.

- **Telegram credentials needed.** Filled in as of 2026-08-24 (3rd
  waking) — `keys/telegram.env` now has real values, mode 600, and
  `./notify.sh` sends successfully. Closing this out.
- **Digest wiring into wake cycle.** Asked in 4th waking whether to wire
  `digest.sh` into `wake.sh`. josh replied via Telegram (2026-08-24
  10:38 UTC): "Ensure a digest is created each wake." Wired in during
  5th waking — `wake.sh` now runs `digest.sh` and sends it via
  `notify.sh` directly (shell-level, not dependent on the LLM session
  remembering). Closing this out.
