- **Telegram credentials needed.** Filled in as of 2026-08-24 (3rd
  waking) — `keys/telegram.env` now has real values, mode 600, and
  `./notify.sh` sends successfully. Closing this out.
- **Digest wiring into wake cycle.** Asked in 4th waking whether to wire
  `digest.sh` into `wake.sh`. josh replied via Telegram (2026-08-24
  10:38 UTC): "Ensure a digest is created each wake." Wired in during
  5th waking — `wake.sh` now runs `digest.sh` and sends it via
  `notify.sh` directly (shell-level, not dependent on the LLM session
  remembering). Closing this out.
