# Ask josh

## Open

(none — see On hold and Resolved below)

## On hold

- **Expose the website publicly?** Built a first static page at
  `website/index.html` (7th waking), verified locally only — not exposed
  (no passwordless sudo to install/configure a web server or touch
  firewall rules; no domain pointed at the box). josh replied (Telegram,
  2026-08-24, 11th waking): "Move on from the website and figure out
  something else to work on while I fix permission issue." Parking this
  until josh says the permission issue is resolved — not re-attempting
  sudo checks each waking per his instruction.

## Resolved

- **"Try permissions again and see if you have them."** josh asked via
  Telegram (2026-08-24 11:31 UTC), almost certainly about the sudo
  blocker noted above. Re-checked (9th waking): `sudo -n true` still
  fails with "a password is required" — still in the `sudo` group but
  no NOPASSWD entry exists yet. No change from before. Still needed for
  installing a web server, opening firewall ports, or a real reboot
  test. Told josh over Telegram.

- **"Check permission now."** josh asked via Telegram (2026-08-24, this
  waking — 10th). Progress this time: `/etc/sudoers` was modified
  today at 11:39 UTC (per `ls -la`, root-owned, mode 0440, can't read
  contents) and `sudo -n -l` now lists `(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` for user
  `agent` — so josh did add a passwordless-sudo rule. But actual sudo
  invocations still fail: `sudo -n true` / `sudo -n whoami` / `sudo -n
  -v` all print "sudo: a password is required" and exit 1. Confirmed
  this isn't the Claude Code sandbox intercepting it — reran with the
  sandbox explicitly disabled and got the identical failure. `sudo -l`
  also shows a second matching line, `(ALL : ALL) ALL` (no NOPASSWD
  tag) — almost certainly the standard Ubuntu `%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL)
  ALL` group rule that every member of the `sudo` group gets. My best
  read: this is a sudoers rule-ordering conflict — sudo uses
  last-match-wins per matching entry, so if the new `agent ALL=(ALL)
  NOPASSWD: ALL` line sits *before* the `%sudo` group line in
  `/etc/sudoers`, the later group rule (no NOPASSWD tag) overrides it
  and a password is required again. I can't fix this myself: reading
  or editing `/etc/sudoers` requires root, which is exactly the
  permission in question (circular). Suggested fix for josh: either
  move the `agent ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` line to the *end* of
  `/etc/sudoers` (after the `%sudo` line), or better, put it in its
  own file under `/etc/sudoers.d/` (e.g. `/etc/sudoers.d/agent`, mode
  0440) since `#includedir /etc/sudoers.d` is processed after the main
  file's rules and would reliably win. Told josh over Telegram with
  this diagnosis.

- **Digest should include global/US news, not just Hacker News.** josh
  asked via Telegram (2026-08-24 11:17 UTC): "also each digest should
  include global and US news updates." Updated `digest.sh` (8th waking)
  to add a "Global news" section from BBC's World RSS feed and a "US
  news" section from NPR's News RSS feed, alongside the existing HN
  section, all parsed with Python's stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` (no
  new dependencies). No auth/API key needed for either feed. Tested
  standalone and end-to-end through `notify.sh` — full 5-item digest is
  ~2.2KB, comfortably under Telegram's 4096-char message limit. No
  wiring change needed in `wake.sh` since it already calls `digest.sh`
  and pipes the output to `notify.sh` every wake. (josh sent a follow-up
  "Add news to digest" ~12 min later, likely crossed in transit with
  this fix — already covered, no further action needed.)

- **Persist agent across reboot.** josh asked via Telegram (2026-08-24
  11:10 UTC): "Make agent persistent upon reboot." Checked (6th waking):
  `cron.service` is systemd-enabled and wanted by `multi-user.target`
  (confirmed via `systemctl show`), the crontab lives in
  `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` on the VM's real persistent disk (this is a
  DigitalOcean KVM VM, not an ephemeral container — `df` shows a normal
  87G root volume), and the cron → nvm → `claude` CLI path in `wake.sh`
  has already run successfully under a real cron firing (4th waking).
  None of that depends on uptime, so a reboot doesn't change it — cron
  will restart automatically and fire `wake.sh` on the next scheduled
  slot. I don't have passwordless sudo so I couldn't force a live reboot
  to prove it end-to-end; flagging that here in case josh wants an
  actual reboot test rather than just config verification. No code
  changes needed — already persistent.

- **Telegram credentials needed.** Filled in as of 2026-08-24 (3rd
  waking) — `keys/telegram.env` now has real values, mode 600, and
  `./notify.sh` sends successfully. Closing this out.
- **Digest wiring into wake cycle.** Asked in 4th waking whether to wire
  `digest.sh` into `wake.sh`. josh replied via Telegram (2026-08-24
  10:38 UTC): "Ensure a digest is created each wake." Wired in during
  5th waking — `wake.sh` now runs `digest.sh` and sends it via
  `notify.sh` directly (shell-level, not dependent on the LLM session
  remembering). Closing this out.
